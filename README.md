## Quoc's TuneIn Take Home

Started with Create React App. 

Deployed - http://bit.ly/QuocTuneIn

`npm start` to run. 

### Prompt 

Mini TuneIn API that returns a list of stations:

https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cdn-web.tunein.com/stations.json



Be creative with this. We want to see a functional site that uses the api. 

The homepage of your app shows a list of available stations to play. You decide how you want to order the stations and how they are displayed.

A user should be able to click on a station in the list

Once a station is clicked, details about the station should be displayed and the associated stream should begin playing

Be creative with tags. Can you help a user decide what to listen to based on tags?

What can the reliability and popularity information associated with a station be used for?

When in doubt, make an executive decision. 

Functionality is more important than the look and feel.
